You need to modify the files so to obtain the following effects:




<ol>

 <li>Create a hierarchical model of a (simplified) horse, composed of the following parts; a. body</li>

 <li>4 legs, each one composed of 2 independent components (upper and lower leg) c. head</li>

 <li>tail</li>

</ol>

All components are cubes, use the cube function present in the file




<ol start="2">

 <li>Add a procedural texture to the body of the horse. The texture should be a checkerboard pattern but with a linear decrease of intensity from the front to the back of the body. Use, as a reference, textureCube4 of Chapter 7 of the examples of the textbook. Notice however that you should not apply a sinusoid but a linear decrease in the direction of the tail.</li>

</ol>




<ol start="3">

 <li>Create a (very simplified) model of a jump obstacle made with cubes. Use, as a reference, one of the following images (your version can be much simpler):</li>

</ol>







<ol start="4">

 <li>Add a button that starts an animation of the horse so that, starting from an initial position where it is standing and positioned along the x axis, it walks by moving (alternatively back and forth) the legs, then jumps above the obstacle and lands after it.</li>

</ol>
